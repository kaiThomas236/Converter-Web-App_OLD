# Converter


CSCI Software Development

Led a small team to create a generalized converter. 
Currencies can be converted, as well as common measurements and the user can even see their weight on other planets.
The currency converter is up to date and pulls from https://exchangeratesapi.io/ 




I built this website years ago now, it was my first one and it shows. All of my CSS is inline, and the elements are poorly organized. If I rebuilt this project now it would be miles better. Maybe I will do that actually :)
